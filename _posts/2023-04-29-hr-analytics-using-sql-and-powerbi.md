The objectives of this project are to analyze human resources dataset and build an interactive visualization (dashboard) using SQL and Microsoft Power BI. Below is the generated dashboard of this project, which contains pages that consist of :
* Employees Diversity
* Retention Analysis
* Salary Analysis
* Salary Details (sub-page of Salary Analysis)

This project dataset consists of the dataset from Kaggle ([The Company](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/koluit/human-resource-data-set-the-company)) in `.txt` format (imported as the database tables in SQL Server Management Studio or SSMS), and generated dataset from SQL query. All of the data in this project are connected from SQL Server Management Studio to Power BI. Here are the dataset that was imported from the original source on Kaggle to SSMS.
* CompanyData.txt (`EmployeeTable`)
* Diversity.txt (`EmployeeDiversity`)

# Exploratory Data Analysis in SQL

There are several pre-visualization analyses that were conducted using SQL query to get more understanding of the dataset. Some of it will be the sources of Power BI dataset.

- Employee's age distribution (named `AgeGroup` dataset as a Power BI data source)
    
    ```sql
    SELECT EmployeeID, 
                        CASE
                            WHEN Age <= 20 THEN '20 and below'
                            WHEN Age BETWEEN 21 AND 30 THEN '21-30'
                            WHEN Age BETWEEN 31 AND 40 THEN '31-40'
                            WHEN Age BETWEEN 41 AND 50 THEN '41-50'
                            WHEN Age BETWEEN 51 AND 60 THEN '51-60'
                            ELSE '61 and above' END AS AgeGroup
    FROM EmployeeTable;
    ```
    
- Number of new employee of by year and office
    
    ```sql
    WITH cte AS
    (
    SELECT
        YEAR(Start_Date) AS Year,
        Office,
        COUNT(YEAR(Start_Date)) AS NewHire,
        RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY YEAR(Start_Date) ORDER BY COUNT(YEAR(Start_Date)) DESC) AS RankofMostHireOffice,
        RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY YEAR(Start_Date) ORDER BY COUNT(YEAR(Start_Date)) ASC) AS RankofLeastHireOffice
    FROM EmployeeTable
    GROUP BY YEAR(Start_Date), Office
    )
    SELECT Year, Office, NewHire
    FROM cte
    WHERE RankofMostHireOffice = 1 OR RankofLeastHireOffice = 1
    ORDER BY Year, NewHire DESC;
    ```
    
- Number of new employees by year and department
    
    ```sql
    WITH cte AS

        RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY YEAR(Start_Date) ORDER BY COUNT(YEAR(Start_Date)) ASC) AS RankofLeastHireDepartment
    FROM EmployeeTable

    )

- Yearly employees retention rate

# Power BI Data Sources

Dataset from **SSMS database tables**:

- `EmployeeTable`
- `EmployeeDiversity`

Dataset were generated from **SQL query**:

- `AgeGroup`
- `YearlyEmployeeInformations`

# Power BI Measures (DAX)

There are four-grouped Measures that were created throughout analyzing and visualizing process in this project (Power BI part), which includes:

### `_HeadCount` Group

- `Head Count` (number of employee in the specific period)
    
    ```
    Head Count = COUNT(YearlyEmployeeInformations[EmployeeID])
    ```
    
- `Male` (number of male employee in the specific period)
    
    ```
    Male = 
    CALCULATE([Head Count];
    FILTER(EmployeeDiversity; EmployeeDiversity[Gender] = "Male"))
    ```
    
- `Female` (number of female employee in the specific period)
    
    ```
    Female = 
    CALCULATE([Head Count];
    FILTER(EmployeeDiversity; EmployeeDiversity[Gender] = "Female"))
    ```
    
- `Last Year Head Count` (number of employee in the last specific period)
    
    ```
    Last Year Head Count = 
    CALCULATE([Head Count]; OFFSET(-1;ALL(YearlyEmployeeInformations[EmpYr])))
    ```
    
- `YoY Head Count` (year-on-year, number of employee)
    
    ```
    YoY Head Count = ([Head Count] / [Last Year Head Count])-1
    ```
    
- `YoY Male` (year-on-year, number of male employee)
    
    ```
    YoY Male = 
    CALCULATE([YoY Head Count];
    FILTER(EmployeeDiversity; EmployeeDiversity[Gender] = "Male"))
    ```
    
- `YoY Female` (year-on-year, number of female employee)
    
    ```
    YoY Female = 
    CALCULATE([YoY Head Count];
    FILTER(EmployeeDiversity; EmployeeDiversity[Gender] = "Female"))
    ```
    
- `Employees with Disability` (number of male employee with disability)
    
    ```
    Employees with Disability = 
    CALCULATE(
        COUNT(YearlyEmployeeInformations[EmployeeID]);
        FILTER(ALLSELECTED(EmployeeDiversity[Disability]); 
    		EmployeeDiversity[Disability]=1))
    ```
    
- `Veteran Employees` (number of veteran employee)
    
    ```
    Veteran Employees = 
    CALCULATE(
        COUNT(YearlyEmployeeInformations[EmployeeID]);
        FILTER(ALLSELECTED(EmployeeDiversity[Veteran]);
    		EmployeeDiversity[Veteran]=1))
    ```
    

### `_HeadDistinctCount` Group

- `Head Count (Distinct)` (number of unique employee in the specific period)
    
    ```
    Head Count (Distinct) = DISTINCTCOUNT(YearlyEmployeeInformations[EmployeeID])
    ```
    
- `Male (Distinct)` (number of unique male employee in the specific period)
    
    ```
    Male (Distinct) = 
    CALCULATE([Head Count (Distinct)];
    FILTER(EmployeeDiversity; EmployeeDiversity[Gender] = "Male"))
    ```
    
- `Female (Distinct)` (number of unique female employee in the specific period)
    
    ```
    Female (Distinct) = 
    CALCULATE([Head Count (Distinct)];
    FILTER(EmployeeDiversity; EmployeeDiversity[Gender] = "Female"))
    ```
    

### `_RetentionRate` Group

- `JoinedEmp` (number of new employees)
    
    ```
    JoinedEmp = SUM(YearlyEmployeeInformations[IsJoin])
    ```
    
- `CumulativeJoin` (cumulative number of new employees)
    
    ```
    CumulativeJoin = 
    CALCULATE([JoinedEmp];
    FILTER(ALL(YearlyEmployeeInformations[EmpYr]);
    YearlyEmployeeInformations[EmpYr] <= MAX(YearlyEmployeeInformations[EmpYr])))
    ```
    
- `LeftEmp` (number of left employees)
    
    ```
    LeftEmp = SUM(YearlyEmployeeInformations[IsLeave])
    ```

    CumulativeLeave = 
    CALCULATE([LeftEmp];
    FILTER(ALL(YearlyEmployeeInformations[EmpYr]);
    YearlyEmployeeInformations[EmpYr] <= MAX(YearlyEmployeeInformations[EmpYr])))
    ```
    
- `Leave` (negative number of the left employees)
    
    ```
    Leave = -1 * [LeftEmp]
    ```
    
- `EndEmp` (number of employees at the end of the period)
    
    ```
    EndEmp = [CumulativeJoin] - [CumulativeLeave]
